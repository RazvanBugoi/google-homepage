# Google Homepage Clone

## This project was about trying to reproduce www.google.com website without using inspector tools as much as possible. 

Things that I have learned during this project include: 

- creating a navbar and a footer section;
- centering elements vertically and horizontally with flexbox;
- adding a background color to elements;
- changing the properties of an element on different states (hover, focus);
- using semantic HTML for the best of my current abilities;
